Customer Churn Prediction Project


Welcome to the Customer Churn Prediction project! This repository contains all the code and resources needed to build, train, and deploy a customer churn prediction model. Churn prediction is a vital task for businesses aiming to retain customers and minimize revenue loss. This project focuses on using machine learning techniques to predict whether a customer is likely to churn, allowing businesses to take proactive measures to prevent churn.

Introduction

Customer churn refers to the phenomenon where customers stop using a company's products or services. Predicting customer churn is essential for businesses to develop strategies for customer retention, improve their services, and maintain a stable revenue stream. This project focuses on building a machine learning model that can predict customer churn based on historical customer data.

Model

We use a Random Forest classifier as the core model for churn prediction due to its ability to handle complex relationships in data and provide feature importance scores. The model is trained on historical customer data to predict whether a customer will churn in the future.

Evaluation

The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC metrics. These metrics provide insights into the model's ability to correctly identify churn cases and non-churn cases.
