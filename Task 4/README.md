SMS Spam Detection Project


Welcome to the SMS Spam Detection project! This repository contains all the code and resources needed to build, train, and deploy a spam detection model for SMS messages. Spam detection is crucial for preventing unwanted messages and providing users with a better communication experience.

Introduction

SMS spam detection involves using machine learning techniques to classify incoming text messages as either spam or legitimate. This project focuses on creating a model that can accurately identify spam messages and prevent them from reaching users' inboxes.

Model

We use a Naive Bayes classifier as the core model for spam detection due to its simplicity and effectiveness in text classification tasks. The model is trained on a bag-of-words representation of the SMS messages.

Evaluation

The model's performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC. These metrics provide insights into the model's ability to correctly classify spam and legitimate messages.
